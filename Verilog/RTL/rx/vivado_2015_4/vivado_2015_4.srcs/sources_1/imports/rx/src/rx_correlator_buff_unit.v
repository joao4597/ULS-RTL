/**
 * GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
 * -This module has access to a memory shared with three other modules
 * -Stores 128 samples surrounding the correlation peak
 * -256 lines in the sahred ram are available to this module, starting at RAM_BASE_ADDRESS
 * -The 256 addresses are used as two 128 lines buffer, one stores the incoming samples
 * the other holds the maximum known up to each point, they alternate roles every time a new maximum
 * is received
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
